# Creating a Skeleton Sintra App as a docker container 

I want to keep this application is simple as possible.
Rails has alot of great built-in stuff, but when we are building modern applications and want to best leverage serverless or managed cloud services with a cloud-first approach, alot of the framework gets abstracted away.

Andrew chose `Sinatra` because he likes using Ruby, and for begineers you won't have to worry about all the magic of Ruby.

We are going to try to keep the code as much as possible in a single file.
